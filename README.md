# Project--AI-Health-Chat-bot-

I created an AI health chatbot to help users identify potential health issues and provide basic advice. It uses Decision Tree and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithms for accurate and reliable predictions. Here’s how it works:  

- Users interact through a simple, conversational interface.  
- The chatbot asks questions based on symptoms entered in natural language.  
- The Decision Tree offers quick, easy-to-understand diagnoses.  
- SVC refines these predictions for better accuracy, even with complex cases.  
- The chatbot provides general advice and flags when professional care is necessary.  

It’s a helpful tool for preliminary health guidance, designed to make basic healthcare more accessible.
